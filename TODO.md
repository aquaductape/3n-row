# ARIA

1. Easier introduction/navigation when user first loads the page
2. ARIA Live Region for updates on game

# UI

1. Currently doesn't have an option which player goes FIRST!
   1. Alternate turns. On local mode, P1 goes first. On multiplayer, first player that starts is random. The rest of the gameplay is alternate turns
2. Icon on player 2 (or either) indicating that it's an AI
3. Since both player option dropdowns share a "general" options, label that section as General Options
4. If option dropdown height is greater than viewport, match viewport height and use inner scrollbars, same with inner list width
5. Tooltip (on menu button and replay button since they are icons)
6. add 3rd slider, to pick who goes first (on vs AI only)
