# FROM NOW ON to animate SVGS with clipping or masking

1. Animating HTMLElements with clip/mask: pre IOS13 don't animate with svg, dont bother please
2. Animating SVG with clip/mask: always use masks, has best browser consistency

# ARIA

1. Easier introduction/navigation when user first loads the page
2. ARIA Live Region for updates on game

# UI

1. Icon on player 2 (or either) indicating that it's an AI
2. If option dropdown height is greater than viewport, match viewport height and use inner scrollbars, same with inner list width
3. Tooltip (on menu button and replay button since they are icons)
4. Logo text on quick start menu
5. dropdown svg mask, for now just place it within HTML element that will be animated, it breaks in Firefox, god knows what Safari will do
